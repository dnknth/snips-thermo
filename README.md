# Voice-control for your heating

This is a [Snips](https://snips.ai/) skill
for voice control of thermostats and thermometers.

Devices must support MQTT in some way, then you can:

* Set and adjust the temperature,
* Query room temperature and heater temperature setting.

See [config.ini.default](config.ini.default) for configuration instructions.

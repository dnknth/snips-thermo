# Settings for a multi-room skill.
#
# The smallest possible configuration looks like this:
#   [DEFAULT]
#   probes = <list of keys for MQTT topics>
#   capabilities = <list of keys for MQTT topics>
#
# See below for an example.
#
# For a multi-room setup, list each room in it's own section,
# with the localized room name as section label and 
# a thermometer aor thermostat device name.
# Example:
#
#   [Kitchen]
#   device = kitchen_heater
#
# Capabilities in the [DEFAULT] section apply to all rooms,
# unless overridden in room sections.
# 
# For rooms with a Snips audio server, add a 'site_id' setting
# with the ID of the Snips audio server
# as given in the 'bind' setting in /etc/snips.toml.
# This is used to infer the room if omitted.
#
# Rooms with no Snips devices should not have a 'site_id'.

[DEFAULT]
probes = get_temp, get_target
capabilities = set_target
device =

# MQTT topics
get_temp = {device}/status/temperature
get_target = {device}/status/target
set_target = {device}/set/target

[Arbeitszimmer]
